# notelights
Programmable LED wall array that responds to digital piano input. Built from scratch out of individual LED bulbs, 26AWG wire, a few loose buttons and switches swiped from the Yale CEID, and a lot of soldering. Controlled by an Arduino with an addressable LED driver chip designed for an eight-digit 7-segment display. I use an Arduino USB Host module (USB-A port) to connect a USB cable and read MIDI inputs from the keyboard. MIDI data used to drive the display includes note on/off timing, pitch, velocity, and sustain pedal press/release.

It has various autonomous and midi-driven modes. The LEDs are spread into a 10'x4' mesh spaced about one foot apart, and the patterns take advantage of the spacing to create various effects (rain drops falling, diagonal "meteors" shooting across, etc)

Pictures/video coming eventually!
